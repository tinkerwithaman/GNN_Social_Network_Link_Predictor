# 🕸️ Advanced Project 42: GNN for Social Network Link Prediction

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project implements a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** using PyTorch Geometric to solve the task of **Link Prediction** within a social network graph. Link prediction is a critical task in social network analysis, aiming to predict missing or future connections between users based on their existing connections and features.

The key advanced component is the use of a GNN to generate node embeddings that capture the local and global structure of the graph, which are then used to calculate the probability of a link existing between two nodes.
